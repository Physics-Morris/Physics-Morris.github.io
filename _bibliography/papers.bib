  abstract={We introduce the Bi-Directional Sparse Hopfield Network (BiSHop), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.},

  abstract={Recently, methods investigating how to adapt large language models (LLMs) for specific sce- narios have gained great attention. Particularly, the concept of persona, originally adopted in dialogue literature, has re-surged as a promising avenue. However, the growing research on persona is relatively disorganized, lacking a systematic overview. To close the gap, we present a comprehensive survey to categorize the current state of the field. We identify two lines of research, namely (1) LLM Role-Playing, where personas are assigned to LLMs, and (2) LLM Personalization, where LLMs take care of user personas. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first survey tailored for LLM role-playing and LLM personalization under the uni- fied view of persona, including taxonomy, current challenges, and potential directions. To foster future endeavors, we actively maintain a paper collection available to the community.},

## What is Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) ?

How to evaluate probablistic forcasting is good or not?
Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) is a evaluation metrics to quantify this.  <d-footnote>Gneiting, T., & Raftery, A. E. (2007). Strictly proper scoring rules, prediction, and estimation. Journal of the American statistical Association, 102(477), 359-378.</d-footnote>

Below is an example of probability forcasting of airline passengers <d-footnote>Data from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/airline-passengers.csv</d-footnote> where blue line is the ground truth and the red line is the forecase mean with the ribbon is various confidence interval.

### Definition
The CRPS measures the difference between a predicted **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) $$ F(x) $$ and the observed value $$ y $$. 
It is defined as:

$$
\text{CRPS}(F, y) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( F(x) - \mathbb{1}(x \geq y) \right)^2 dx.
$$

The perfect prediction is $$ \mathbb{1}(x \geq y) $$ where the CDF is $$ 1 $$ greater and equal to observation $$ y $$.
The square of difference measure the closeness of prediction density to this perfect density.


### Quantile Loss
The quantile loss $$\rho_{\alpha}(u)$$ at a quantile level $$\alpha \in [0, 1]$$ for a deviation $$u = z - q(\alpha)$$ is defined as:

$$
\rho_{\alpha}(u) =
\begin{cases} 
    \alpha \cdot u & \text{if } u \geq 0, \\
    (1 - \alpha) \cdot |u| & \text{if } u < 0.
\end{cases}
$$

where $$z$$ is the true value, $$q(\alpha)$$ is the predicted quantile at level $\alpha$, and $$u = z - q(\alpha)$$ is the difference between true and prediction.
The intuition make sense if we want to predict 75th quantile, we will penelize $$3$$ times for under-estimated than over-estimated, for more example you can refer to here <d-footnote>https://www.kaggle.com/code/vyacheslavefimov/quantile-loss-quantile-regression</d-footnote>.



### Quantile Decomposition of CRPS
We can rewrite CRPS as integral over quantile loss <d-footnote>Gneiting, T., & Ranjan, R. (2011). Comparing density forecasts using threshold-and quantile-weighted scoring rules. Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 29(3), 411-422.</d-footnote>

$$
\begin{align}
\text{CRPS}(F, y) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( F(x) - \mathbb{1}(x \geq y) \right)^2 dx \\
&= \int_{0}^{1} 2 \rho_{\alpha} \left( z - q(\alpha) \right) d \alpha,
\end{align}
$$

where (2) is the quantile decomposition of the CRPS.
The key step in the derivation involves performing a **change of variable** from $$ x $$ to $$ \alpha $$ and utilizing the relationship between the quantile function and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Specifically, the quantile function $$ q(\alpha) $$ is defined as the inverse of the CDF $$ F(x) $$:
$$
\begin{align}
q(\alpha) = F^{-1}(\alpha) = \inf \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid F(x) \geq \alpha \}.
\end{align}
$$

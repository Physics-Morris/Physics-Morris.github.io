Inspired by [Chi-Ning Chou’s](https://cnchou.github.io/) blog about his PhD reflection, I’ve set some goals as I begin my PhD at UNC Chapel Hill:

---

- 🏅 Best paper award at a top-tier conference (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR)
- 🧠 One paper in Nature or Science
- 🌍 Internship at a top lab (e.g., DeepMind, OpenAI)
- 🏞️ Visit 10 national parks in US
- 🏃 Qualify for and run the Boston Marathon

Inspired by [Chi-Ning Chou’s](https://cnchou.github.io/) blog about his PhD reflection, I’ve set some goals as I begin my PhD at UNC Chapel Hill:

---

🏅 Best paper award at a top-tier conference (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) <br>
🧠 One paper in Nature or Science <br>
🌍 Internship at a top lab (e.g., DeepMind, OpenAI) <br>
🏞️ Visit 10 national parks in US <br>
🏃 Qualify for and run the Boston Marathon <br>

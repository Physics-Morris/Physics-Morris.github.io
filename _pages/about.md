Hey, my name is Morris Huang (黃禹超 in Chinese). I have recently graduated with a Master's in Physics under the guidance of <a href='https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/goan.html'>Prof. Hsi-Sheng Goan</a> at <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/'>National Taiwan University</a>. My research interest lies in the intersection of physics and computation.
I have experience in machine learning, parallel computing, particle-in-cell simulation, quantum opitmization, quatnum machine learning, and molecular dynamics.

I am passionate about interdisciplinary research at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. My work focuses on applying machine learning techniques to quantum computers with theoretical guarantees, aiming to develop novel algorithms to enhance quantum computation efficiency and effectiveness. I am also a prospective Ph.D. applicants for fall 2024.
